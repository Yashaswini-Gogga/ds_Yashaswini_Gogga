## 📦 Datasets Used

1. **Historical Trader Data (Hyperliquid)**

2. **Fear & Greed Index**
   - Fields: date, classification (Fear / Greed)

## 🧠 Objective

> Analyze how trading behavior (profitability, risk, volume, fees) aligns or diverges from overall **market sentiment** (fear vs greed). Identify hidden trends or signals that can drive smarter trading strategies.

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)**
- **Google Colab**
- **Tableau / Power BI (optional)**
- **GitHub**

## 📊 Key Insights

- **Traders made higher profits during Greed** periods on average.
- **Fee and risk exposure was higher during Fear** periods, suggesting more aggressive or reactive behavior.
- **Trade volume was significantly higher** on Greed days, possibly driven by optimism or trend momentum.

> These patterns suggest that market sentiment strongly influences trading behavior and could inform risk management or entry strategies.
