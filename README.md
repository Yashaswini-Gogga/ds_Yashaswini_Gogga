## 🧠 Objective

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)**
- **Google Colab**
- **Tableau / Power BI (optional)**
- **GitHub**

## 📊 Key Insights

- **Traders made higher profits during Greed** periods on average.
- **Fee and risk exposure was higher during Fear** periods, suggesting more aggressive or reactive behavior.
- **Trade volume was significantly higher** on Greed days, possibly driven by optimism or trend momentum.

> These patterns suggest that market sentiment strongly influences trading behavior and could inform risk management or entry strategies.
